All files required to create a .exe port scanner that can easily be saved onto a USB device.
My colleague and I wrote this together from a very limited base code that could only scan TCP ports 80, 443, and 23.
My focus was on the main, a way to add firewall rules, and any display features for the data collected.
The .ico file was an AI generated image that I converted into an icon for the pre-compiled program.
